# NYC Taxi Fare Regression Analysis:

This project analyzes New York City Taxi data to predict taxi fares based on trip characteristics. Using data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling, it aims to uncover key factors influencing fares and build a predictive model.

## Features:

### Data Cleaning:

- Removed missing and duplicate entries.
- Corrected data types and handled outliers in trip-related features.

### Feature Engineering:

- Calculated trip duration and other relevant metrics.
- Transformed skewed distributions using log transformations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized relationships between trip features and fares.
- Identified patterns in fare distributions and user behavior.

### Regression Modeling:

- Built linear regression models to predict fare amounts based on trip distance, time, and passenger count.
- Evaluated models using metrics like MSE and RÂ².

### Interactive Visualizations:

- Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to create insightful visualizations.
