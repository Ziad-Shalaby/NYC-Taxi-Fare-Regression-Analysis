# NYC Taxi Fare Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting taxi fares in New York City using regression analysis. The dataset used contains detailed information on trips, including pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and trip distances. The goal is to build and evaluate regression models that accurately predict taxi fares based on these features.
